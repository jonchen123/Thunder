# Thunder
Small guided hack in Ruby created at HackGT during a talk by Shehmeer Jiwani, GitHub username dragonai.
This project utilizes the Twilio and Google APIs to take a SMS message request sent to a Twilio number and respond with the place found according to the request and directions too.

ngrok is also used to provide outside access to the localhost.
