# Thunder
Small hack in Ruby created at HackGT during a talk by Shehmeer Jiwani.
This project utilizes the Twilio and Google APIs to take a SMS message request sent to a Twilio number and respond with the place found according to the request and directions from the users current location too (directions are still a work in progress). Currently, the user requests only work with food-related queries.

ngrok is also used to provide outside access to the localhost. 

Original code used as inspiration for the talk from here: https://github.com/dragonai/thndr-v2



Increased functionality is still being added.
TODO: Use Google Places photo to provide a picture of the place if necessary
